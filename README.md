# OpenIndustryProject

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY BEING PORTED TO GODOT, WE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTING FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS AT THIS TIME. 

Thank you for you support. 

Free and Open-source PLC driven warehouse/manufacturing simulation made with [OPC UA .NET](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard), and [libplctag](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag). 

The goal is to provide an open platform for developers to contribute to the creation of virtual industrial equipment/devices and for people to be able to test their ideas or simply educate themselves using a real PLC.

Scroll down to the **Getting Started** section for information on how to work with this project.

REWORKING IN GODOT

## Importing Models

Although this project has a few models, you maybe interested in adding more. 

This is a good resource for free industrial parts CAD models: [3dfindit](https://www.3dfindit.com/en/)

It is recommened to export the files in their native format (usually STEP), modify them if needed for usage in Unity in any CAD software and then export as FBX for additional work in Blender, or to be imported straight into Unity. 

Alternatively most manufacturers provide the CAD files directly on their own website. 

## Help Wanted

- More equipment and devices
- Better exception handling
- Review code
- Documentation
- Training videos?
